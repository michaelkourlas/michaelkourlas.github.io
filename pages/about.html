        <p>My name is Michael Kourlas, and I am a student at McGill University majoring in computer engineering with a 
        minor in software engineering. I intend to study business administration after working for several years following 
        my graduation in 2016 as I would like to work in product management.</p>

        <p>I have received several scholastic awards, including the national Schulich Leader Scholarship, the Louis C. Ho 
        Scholarship in Engineering, the John Howard Ambrose scholarship, the McGill Dean’s Honour List, and the Governor 
        General’s Academic Medal. I have also won multiple awards in Ontario provincial debate and speech competitions.</p>

        <p>For the past four years, I have interned with Solace Systems, an Ottawa-area high tech startup specializing in 
        application-aware networking. My work at Solace primarily consisted of developing software and test suites for 
        their routers. I also developed API samples which were distributed to customers; improved an existing build system 
        by setting up a continuous integration server and implementing a static analysis testing system; developed internal 
        productivity tools, including a planning system similar to Microsoft Project; and created internal technical 
        documentation. I will be working for Solace as a software developer after I graduate.</p>

        <p>In my spare time, I enjoy working on personal programming projects. I developed js2xmlparser, a Node.js module 
        that has been downloaded over 5 million times and incorporated into 72 other packages to date. I also developed 
        VoIP.ms SMS, an Android application that has become the standard way to send and receive SMS messages on Android 
        devices using VoIP.ms, a particular VoIP provider.</p>
