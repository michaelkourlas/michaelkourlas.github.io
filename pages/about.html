        <p> My name is Michael Kourlas, and I am a student at McGill University majoring in computer engineering
            with a minor in software engineering. I intend to study business administration after working for
            several years following my graduation in 2016. I have received several scholastic awards, including
            the national Schulich Leader Scholarship, the John Howard Ambrose scholarship, the McGill Dean’s
            Honour List and the Governor General’s Academic Medal. I have also won multiple awards in Ontario
            provincial debate and speech competitions.
        </p>
        <p> For the past four years, I have worked for Solace Systems, an Ottawa-area high tech startup
            specializing in application-aware networking. My work at Solace primarily consisted of developing
            software and test suites for their routers. I also developed API samples which were distributed to
            customers; improved an existing build system by setting up a continuous integration server and
            implementing a static analysis testing system; developed internal productivity tools, including a
            planning system similar to Microsoft Project; and created internal technical documentation.
        </p>
        <p> In my spare time, I developed js2xmlparser, a Node.js module that has been downloaded over 1.4
            million times and incorporated into 36 other packages to date. I also developed and monetized DOTX
            to DOCX Converter, desktop productivity software that has been downloaded over 80,000 times to date.
            Finally, I developed VoIP.ms SMS, an Android application.
        </p>
